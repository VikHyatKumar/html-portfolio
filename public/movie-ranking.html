<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>The Movie 3 Idiots is one of the best movies of Bollywood
 because there are many reasons behind the success of the movie. 
 It has tells the true story about an engineer. 
 How is their life revolving around friends, family and college.</p>

 <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

 <p>
    This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. 
    I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time.
    Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far.
    Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. 
    The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, 
    the best movie ever!

 <h3>Inception</h3>

 <p>
    Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, 
    depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is
    highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can 
    sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. 
    This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher 
    Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously 
    blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception.
